	abstract = {The growing popularity of soccer has led to the prediction of match results becoming of interest to the research community. The aim of this research is to detect the effects of weather on the result of matches by implementing Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, and Extremely Randomized Trees Classiﬁer. The analysis was executed using the Spanish La Liga and Segunda division from the seasons 2013–2014 to 2017–2018 in combination with weather data. Two tasks were proposed as part of this study: the ﬁrst was to ﬁnd out whether the game will end in a draw, a win by the hosts or a victory by the guests, and the second was to determine whether the match will end in a draw or if one of the teams will win. The results show that, for the ﬁrst task, Extremely Randomized Trees Classiﬁer is a better method, with an accuracy of 65.9\%, and, for the second task, Support Vector Machine yielded better results with an accuracy of 79.3\%. Moreover, it is possible to predict whether the game will end in a draw or not with 0.85 AUC-ROC. Additionally, for comparative purposes, the analysis was also performed without weather data.},

Specifically, we implement and test nine techniques using real-world datasets of 1280 games over 5 seasons from the National Football League (NFL). We test the nine different classifier techniques using a total of 42 features for each team and we find that the best performing algorithms are able to improve one previous published works. The algoriothms achieve an accuracy of between 44.64\% for a Guassian Process classifier to 67.53\% with a Naïve Bayes classifer. We also test each classifier on a year by year basis and compare our results to those of the bookmakers and other leading academic papers.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the use of observed and predicted match statistics as inputs to forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. It is shown that, were it possible to know the match statistics in advance, highly informative forecasts of the match outcome could be made. Whilst, in practice, match statistics are never available prior to the match, this leads to a simple philosophy. If match statistics can be predicted pre-match, and if those predictions are accurate enough, it follows that informative match forecasts can be made. It is shown that Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) ratings, introduced in a recent paper, provide a suitable methodology for predicting match statistics in advance and that they are informative enough to provide information beyond that reﬂected in the odds. A long term and robust gambling proﬁt is demonstrated when the forecasts are combined with two betting strategies.},

Selecting the parameter k with the highest classification accuracy is crucial for kNN. There's no doubt that the leave-one-out cross validation (LOO-CV) is the best method to do this work as its almost unbiased property. However, it is too time consuming to be used in practice especially for large data. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for selecting an optimal neighborhood size k. We found that the classification accuracy of LOO-CV is approximate concave for the parameter k. And a search method is proposed to pick out the optimal value of k. An empirical study conducted on 8 standard databases from the UCI repository shows that the new strategy can find the optimal k with significantly less time than the LOO-CV method.},

Using television viewing figures for eight seasons from the English Premier League, we show that uncertainty of outcome does not have the hypothesised effect on television audience demand. Separating uncertainty of outcome effects by season, the results show that, at best, uncertainty of outcome had imprecise effects on audiences in earlier seasons, but zero effects in later seasons. Television audiences have evolved to exhibit preferences for talent. We suggest that the notion of a pure sporting contest in which uncertainty of outcome matters is no longer relevant and more important is the extent to which sports teams and leagues can increase the quality of the talent on show.},

Further, we develop a model that predicts bookmaker odds. Combining a predictive model based on results and a bookmaker model based on previous quoted odds allows us to compare directly William Hill opinion of various teams with the team ratings generated by the predictive model. We also compare the objective value of individual home advantage and distance travelled with the value attributed to these factors by bookmakers. We show that there are systematic biases in bookmaker odds, and that these biases cannot be explained by William Hill odds omitting valuable, or excluding extraneous, information.},

Several DNA viruses belonging to this group are known to produce human disease from the life-threatening variola virus (VARV) (the causative agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus (MPXV), cowpox virus (CPXV), and vaccinia virus (VACV). These orthopoxviruses still remain a public health concern as VACV or CPXV still cause emerging endemic threads, especially in developing countries. MPXV is able to cause sporadic human outbreaks of a smallpox-like zoonotic disease and, in May 2022, hundreds of cases related to MPXV have been reported from more than 30 countries around the globe. At the end of July, monkeypox (MPX) outbreak was even declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Many aspects remain unclear regarding this outbreak and a deep understanding of orthopoxvirus might have crucial and evident implications. During the era in which people under 45 years old are not protected against VACV, the potential use of orthopoxviruses as a biological weapon raises global concern considering the rapid spreading of the current MPX outbreak in vulnerable populations. Hence, we review the most recent evidence about phylogenesis, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment for this concerning disease.},

	abstract = {Recent studies show that models trained on synthetic datasets are able to achieve better generalizable person re-identification (GPReID) performance than that trained on public real-world datasets. On the other hand, due to the limitations of real-world person ReID datasets, it would also be important and interesting to use large-scale synthetic datasets as test sets to benchmark person ReID algorithms. Yet this raises a critical question: is synthetic dataset reliable for benchmarking generalizable person re-identification? In the literature there is no evidence showing this. To address this, we design a method called Pairwise Ranking Analysis (PRA) to quantitatively measure the ranking similarity and perform the statistical test of identical distributions. Specifically, we employ Kendall rank correlation coefficients to evaluate pairwise similarity values between algorithm rankings on different datasets. Then, a non-parametric two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is performed for the judgement of whether algorithm ranking correlations between synthetic and real-world datasets and those only between real-world datasets lie in identical distributions. We conduct comprehensive experiments, with ten representative algorithms, three popular real-world person ReID datasets, and three recently released large-scale synthetic datasets. Through the designed pairwise ranking analysis and comprehensive evaluations, we conclude that a recent large-scale synthetic dataset ClonedPerson can be reliably used to benchmark GPReID, statistically the same as real-world datasets. Therefore, this study guarantees the usage of synthetic datasets for both source training set and target testing set, with completely no privacy concerns from real-world surveillance data. Besides, the study in this paper might also inspire future designs of synthetic datasets.},

Through the designed pairwise ranking analysis and comprehensive evaluations, we conclude that a recent large-scale synthetic dataset ClonedPerson can be reliably used to benchmark GPReID, statistically the same as real-world datasets. Therefore, this study guarantees the usage of synthetic datasets for both source training set and target testing set, with completely no privacy concerns from real-world surveillance data. Besides, the study in this paper might also inspire future designs of synthetic datasets.},

	abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

How your credit card account number is protected when you make a purchase over the Internet? The answer is algorithms. And how do these mathematical formulations translate themselves into your GPS, your laptop, or your smart phone? This book offers an engagingly written guide to the basics of computer algorithms. In Algorithms Unlocked, Thomas Cormen—coauthor of the leading college textbook on the subject—provides a general explanation, with limited mathematics, of how algorithms enable computers to solve problems.Readers will learn what computer algorithms are, how to describe them, and how to evaluate them. They will discover simple ways to search for information in a computer; methods for rearranging information in a computer into a prescribed order (“sorting”); how to solve basic problems that can be modeled in a computer with a mathematical structure called a “graph” (useful for modeling road networks, dependencies among tasks, and financial relationships); how to solve problems that ask questions about strings of characters such as DNA structures; the basic principles behind cryptography; fundamentals of data compression; and even that there are some problems that no one has figured out how to solve on a computer in a reasonable amount of time.},

Design Descriptive case series.
Setting A regional high consequences infectious disease centre with associated primary and secondary care referrals, and affiliated sexual health centres in south London between May and July 2022.
Participants 197 patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed monkeypox infection.
Results The median age of participants was 38 years. All 197 participants were men, and 196 identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. All presented with mucocutaneous lesions, most commonly on the genitals (n=111 participants, 56.3\%) or in the perianal area (n=82, 41.6\%). 170 (86.3\%) participants reported systemic illness. The most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9\%), lymphadenopathy (114, 57.9\%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5\%). 102/166 (61.5\%) developed systemic features before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestations and 64 (38.5\%) after (n=4 unknown). 27 (13.7\%) presented exclusively with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic features. 71 (36.0\%) reported rectal pain, 33 (16.8\%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7\%) penile oedema. 27 (13.7\%) had oral lesions and 9 (4.6\%) had tonsillar signs. 70/195 (35.9\%) participants had concomitant HIV infection. 56 (31.5\%) of those screened for sexually transmitted infections had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection. Overall, 20 (10.2\%) participants were admitted to hospital for the management of symptoms, most commonly rectal pain and penile swelling.
Conclusions These findings confirm the ongoing unprecedented community transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men seen in the UK and many other non-endemic countries. A variable temporal association was observed between mucocutaneous and systemic features, suggesting a new clinical course to the disease. New clinical presentations of monkeypox infection were identified, including rectal pain and penile oedema. These presentations should be included in public health messaging to aid early diagnosis and reduce onward transmission.},

	abstract = {Background Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a serious infectious disease with a fatality of up to 30\%. To identify the severity of SFTS precisely and quickly is important in clinical practice. Methods From June to July 2020, 71 patients admitted to the Infectious Department of Joint Logistics Support Force No. 990 Hospital were enrolled in this study. The most frequently observed symptoms and laboratory parameters on admission were collected by investigating patients’ electronic records. Decision trees were built to identify the severity of SFTS. Accuracy and Youden’s index were calculated to evaluate the identification capacity of the models. Results Clinical characteristics, including body temperature (p = 0.011), the size of the lymphadenectasis (p = 0.021), and cough (p = 0.017), and neurologic symptoms, including lassitude (p{\textless}0.001), limb tremor (p{\textless}0.001), hypersomnia (p = 0.009), coma (p = 0.018) and dysphoria (p = 0.008), were significantly different between the mild and severe groups. As for laboratory parameters, PLT (p = 0.006), AST (p{\textless}0.001), LDH (p{\textless}0.001), and CK (p = 0.003) were significantly different between the mild and severe groups of SFTS patients. A decision tree based on laboratory parameters and one based on demographic and clinical characteristics were built. Comparing with the decision tree based on demographic and clinical characteristics, the decision tree based on laboratory parameters had a stronger prediction capacity because of its higher accuracy and Youden’s index. Conclusion Decision trees can be applied to predict the severity of SFTS.},

	abstract = {Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing gradient descent.},
